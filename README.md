# optixRendererForSUNCG
An optix path tracer current designed for rendering SUNCG dataset

## Dependencies and Compiling the code
The requirements are almost the same as [optix_advanced_samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/optix_advanced_samples). 
We also need opencv 2 for image processing. 
ccmake is needed to compile the code. Please check [INTALL-LINUX.txt](./INSTALL-LINUX.txt) and [INSTALL-WIN.txt](./INSTALL-WIN.txt) for details.
